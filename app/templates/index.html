<p>There are three different types of corrective osteotomies/ostectomies described in equine literature. </p>

The step ostectomy in the sagittal plane, the step osteotomy in the frontal plane and the closing wedge ostectomy.[1]
In equine surgery osteotomies/ostectomies are performed to correct angular limb deformities or malunions.
In human medicine there are several descriptions for single cut osteotomies the deformities mostly occur because of malunion.[2-8]

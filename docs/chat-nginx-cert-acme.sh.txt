User: 
Explain how to obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt for the subdomain wiki.osteotomytool.de

Assistant: 
Sure, I can guide you on how you can obtain a free SSL certificate for your subdomain from Let's Encrypt. The recommended way to do this is by using Certbot, which is a free, open source tool developed specifically to work with Let's Encrypt.

Follow the steps below:

1. Install Certbot: Depending on your web server and OS, the command to install Certbot may differ. You can follow the instructions available on the Certbot site (https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) to install it on your system.

2. Run Certbot: After installing Certbot, you need to run it. Choose the correct command based on your webserver. If it is Nginx, then:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d wiki.osteotomytool.de
```
   
Or in case of Apache webserver:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d wiki.osteotomytool.de
```

Specifying `-d wiki.osteotomytool.de` specifies the subdomain you want the certificate for.

This command will take care of everything for you. It will communicate with the Let's Encrypt CA and challenge a series of authentication checks to verify that you actually own the domain you claim to. If all checks pass, then Certbot will automatically reconfigure your web server to use SSL and restart it for you.

3. Verify Certificate: You can verify the status of your SSL certificate with the following command:

```bash
sudo certbot certificates
```

4. Automatic Renewal: Let's Encrypt's certificates are only valid for 90 days. However, Certbot would have already setup a cronjob or systemd timer that will renew your certificates automatically.

Please note that the domain wiki.osteotomytool.de must be correctly configured and pointing to your server IP where you're running Certbot.

Remember that even though Let's Encrypt provides free certificates, they're still trusted by all major browsers.

An important thing to consider: Certbot needs either HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443) access to your server from the public Internet to perform domain validation, so make sure to allow traffic on these ports.

Don't forget to replace `wiki.osteotomytool.de` in the commands above with your actual domain name.

User: 
On the same server I already have a docker flask app with a valid ssl certificate for the main domain osteotomytool.de online. Would this certificate still be valid after running certbot for wiki.osteotomytool.de?

Assistant: 
Yes, obtaining an SSL certificate for the subdomain (wiki.osteotomytool.de) using Certbot will not invalidate the SSL certificate for the main domain (osteotomytool.de). 

Both the main domain and the subdomain are considered separate entities, each capable of having their own SSL certificates. Therefore, you can safely run Certbot for your subdomain, and it won't affect the current SSL certificate for your main domain.

However, you would have to make sure your server configurations for both the main domain and the subdomain are correctly set up to use their respective SSL certificates. 

If you are planning to use Let's Encrypt for both, it's important to know that Certbot can handle multiple domains or subdomains and issue separate certificates for each or a single certificate covering all of them depending on your needs. For example, you can include multiple `-d` flags to cover multiple domains/subdomains in one certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de
```

This will generate one certificate that covers all three domains. 

Remember that Let's Encrypt SSL certificates are valid for 90 days and will need to be renewed. Certbot will usually set up auto-renewal for you.

error: system does not fully support snapd: cannot mount squashfs image using "squashfs": mount:
       /tmp/sanity-mountpoint-118362096: mount failed: Operation not permitted.

Assistant: 
It seems like your current system is missing squashfs, which is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux, or it's not configured correctly. Snap packages rely on this filesystem, and hence the error message in your snap installation.

Here's a checklist of things you can try:

1. Ensure squashfs module is loaded: Use the following command to load the squashfs module.

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe squashfs
   ```

   You could check if it's loaded using `lsmod | grep squashfs`, which will list the loaded modules that match 'squashfs'.

2. If the above step doesn't solve the issue, it might be that your Kernel doesn't support squashfs. Some providers like OpenVZ can run on a custom or old Kernel which might lack support for squashfs. In such a case, you may need to upgrade your Kernel or ask your provider if they can provide a different Kernel with squashfs support enabled.

Note: Before making considerable changes to your system, please ensure to backup all significant data and configurations.

User: 
uwe@h2938789:~$ sudo modprobe squashfs 
modprobe: ERROR: ../libkmod/libkmod.c:514 lookup_builtin_file() could not open builtin file '/lib/modules/4.19.0/modules.builtin.bin'
modprobe: FATAL: Module squashfs not found in directory /lib/modules/4.19.0

Assistant: 
The error indicates that your system doesn't have the `squashfs` module built into its kernel. This is the likely cause of the issue. The `squashfs` module is necessary for mounting the filesystems of Snap packages, thus it is a crucial requirement for snapd to function properly.

You can verify this with the following command:
```bash
grep -i squash /boot/config-$(uname -r)
```

If `squashfs` module is not enabled you will get an output something like this: `# CONFIG_SQUASHFS is not set`

The proper way to address this would be to switch to a kernel that includes this module out of the box. This could mean using a stock distribution kernel instead of a custom one, or compiling a custom kernel with the `squashfs` and `squashfs-tools` included when configuring the kernel.

Contact your hosting provider and check if they provide kernels with `squashfs` support. It's crucial to note that manipulating your server's kernel is a risky process, so proceed with caution, ideally with the aid of your hosting provider's support resources. Above all, before making significant changes to your server, be sure to backup any important data stored there.

User: 
uwe@h2938789:~$ grep -i squash /boot/config-$(uname -r)
grep: /boot/config-4.19.0: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

Assistant: 
Apologies for the confusion. The `grep` command didn't return any output because it seems the kernel config file for your running kernel is missing in the `/boot` directory. This might be due to some specific configuration for your hosting provider.

However, based on your previous error messages, it is clear that your system lacks necessary `squashfs` support. 

If switching the kernel or compiling a custom kernel is not an option due to hosting constraints or other reasons, you might want to consider other alternatives to Snapd, depending on what software you're trying to install. Many popular software that are available as snaps are usually also available through other distribution methods, such as:

1. **Official software repositories**: Debian, like most Linux distributions, has official software repositories. Always check here first.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <package-name>
```
   
2. **AppImages**: Some software is distributed through AppImages. These are standalone packages that contain everything the software needs to run.

3. **FlatPak**: This is an alternative to Snap. It isn't as widely used as Snap, but it does have some noteworthy advantages.

Remember, the best method of installation depends on what software you're trying to install on your server.

How to get a valid certificate analog to `sudo certbot --nginx -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de`
without using certbot?

Assistant: 
Certbot is one of the most common tools used to obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt, but it's not the only one. There are many other ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) clients that can interact with the Let's Encrypt API to seamlessly obtain SSL certificates. One of them is **acme.sh**. 

Follow the below steps to install `acme.sh` and issue an SSL certificate:

1. **Install acme.sh**: You can install acme.sh by running this command:

    ```bash
    curl https://get.acme.sh | sh
    ```

2. Close the current terminal and open a new one to ensure that the environment variables are properly updated.

3. **Issue the certificate**: You can now issue the certificate. If you are using nginx, issue the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo ~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue --nginx -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de
    ```

    Replace `-d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de` with the domain names you want to secure.

4. **Install the certificate**: After successfully issuing the certificate, you can install it into nginx with this command:

    ```bash
    sudo ~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --installcert -d osteotomytool.de \
    --key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.key  \
    --fullchain-file /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.cer \
    --reloadcmd     "service nginx reload"
    ```

    Replace `/etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.key` and `/etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.cer` with the keys you want to secure.

    **NOTE:** The `--reloadcmd` will ensure that Nginx is reloaded automatically whenever the cert is renewed.

Remember, acme.sh also provides auto renewal just like certbot, so you wouldn't have to worry about the certificate expiring.

As always, remember to replace `osteotomytool.de`, `www.osteotomytool.de` and `wiki.osteotomytool.de` with your actual domain name.

User: 
acme.sh recommends the installation as root with:
root@h2938789:/home/uwe# curl https://get.acme.sh | sh -s email=my@example.com
what does sh -s email=my@example.com mean? Which Email should I use?

Assistant: 
The `sh -s email=my@example.com` part of the command is passing an argument to the script that is being fetched by `curl` and run by `sh` (a shell interpreter).

`-s` tells `sh` to read commands from the standard input. So the standard input here is your script fetched by `curl`.

`email=my@example.com` is an argument getting passed to the script. When the ACME client (acme.sh) creates an account with the Let's Encrypt's ACME service to issue certificates, it needs an email address. Let's Encrypt uses this email to send notifications regarding any issues with your certificates or important expiry notifications.

You should replace `my@example.com` with an email address that you actively monitor. Be sure to use an actual email that you have access to, as this will be Let's Encrypt's primary method of contacting you if there are any issues.

User: 
acme recommendation:
Example 2: Multiple domains in the same cert.

acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com -d cp.example.com -w /home/wwwroot/example.com
The parameter /home/wwwroot/example.com or /home/username/public_html or /var/www/html is the web root folder where you host your website files. You MUST have write access to this folder.

Second argument "example.com" is the main domain you want to issue the cert for. You must have at least one domain there.

You must point and bind all the domains to the same webroot dir: /home/wwwroot/example.com.

The certs will be placed in ~/.acme.sh/example.com/

The certs will be renewed automatically every 60 days.

If I follow the acme recommendations, the command for creating my  certs would be:
acme.sh --issue -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de -w /var/www/html 

with:
uwe@h2938789://var/www/html$ la

drwxr-xr-x  2 www-data www-data 4096 Jan 31 11:10 testpage

where mediawiki and testpage are the root folders of my websites where the certificates are needed for.

Assistant: 
Yes, you correctly understood the instructions from the `acme.sh` documentation. 

However, before executing, you need to ensure that for each domain you mentioned in the command, the DNS of that domain has been pointed to the server where you are running this command. 

Here's the command for issuing certificates for your domains:

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de -w /var/www/html
```

`-d` specifies the domain names for which you're requesting certificates. The `-w` specifies the webroot path. The ACME server (Let's Encrypt in this case) uses this location to verify domain ownership by writing temporary files there.

After a successful execution of this command, as you mentioned, your certificate and private key will be stored in `~/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de/`

Keep in mind, these certificates need to be used in the web server configuration (`nginx` configuration if you are using `nginx`), and your web server has to be reloaded or restarted for these new certificates to take effect.

It's important to note that the acme.sh script must be run with sufficient permissions to be able to write to the specified webroot directory. Since you have specified /var/www/html, you might need to run the command with `sudo` or as root if your normal user doesn't have write permissions to that directory. 

Remember, acme.sh will automatically attempt to renew the certificates when necessary. However, it's your responsibility to ensure that the service (like `nginx`) using these certificates gets reloaded after the certificate renewal. You can use `--reloadcmd "service nginx reload"` option with `acme.sh --installcert` commands to automate this. 

Before running these commands, please ensure to backup your existing configuration and data.

User: 
Strato info:
Beim Anlegen einer Subdomain werden die DNS Einstellungen und das Umleitungsziel der Domain nicht übernommen. 
Is this a problem?

Assistant: 
In your case, what this message means is that when you create a subdomain (for example, `wiki.osteotomytool.de`), the DNS settings and the redirect target of the main domain (`osteotomytool.de`) will not be used for the subdomain. Instead, each subdomain will have its own DNS settings and redirect target.

For obtaining SSL certificates and setting up your web server, this is not problematic as long as the DNS records for all the subdomains are correctly pointed to your server. For each of your subdomains, you need to ensure there is a DNS 'A' record that points to your server's IP address.

Let's Encrypt verifies domain validation by checking the server where your domain's DNS points to. So, if all your domains and subdomains point correctly to your server and your web server (e.g., nginx) is correctly configured, you can obtain SSL certificates for them.

In conclusion, this is not a problem but you have to manage the DNS and redirection settings for each subdomain separately, which is a common practice.

User: 
how to configure nginx correctly for creating the certificates for wiki.osteotomytool.de and test
.osteotomytool.de

Assistant: 
To create certificates for `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de`, you first need to set up two server blocks in your Nginx configuration file for these subdomains. Each server block will define the way traffic is handled for that specific subdomain.

Here is a template of how it should look:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name wiki.osteotomytool.de;

    root /var/www/html/mediawiki;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name test.osteotomytool.de;

    root /var/www/html/testpage;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
    }
}
```
Please replace `/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock` with your PHP-FPM actual path if necessary.

Each `server` block sets up a configuration for a subdomain. Replace `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de` in `server_name` with your actual subdomains and `/var/www/mediawiki` and `/var/www/html/testpage` in `root` with the path to the root directory of your website files.

To save and exit, press `CTRL+X`, followed by `Y`, then `ENTER` if you're using nano. Check the configuration for syntax errors with `sudo nginx -t`. If there are no errors, restart Nginx to enable your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

After the Nginx configuration is correctly set up, you'll be able to create certificates for your domains. 

Please note that the Nginx configuration here is basic and might need to be adapted based on your application needs.

Also, remember to update the DNS records for the subdomains and point them to the IP address of the server where Nginix is running.

Once everything is set, you can proceed with executing the earlier mentioned `acme.sh` command to generate the SSL certificates for your domains.

User: 
the `test.osteotomytool.de` consists only of a index.html in `/var/www/html/testpage`

Assistant: 
If your `test.osteotomytool.de` website is just made up of static `.html` files, you can simplify your Nginx configuration for it.

Nginx treats `.html` files as static files and serves them directly without needing to interact with a PHP process, which simplifies the setup. Here's how you can configure the server block for `test.osteotomytool.de`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name test.osteotomytool.de;

    root /var/www/html/testpage;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

This server block directs Nginx to listen for requests for `test.osteotomytool.de` and to serve files for those requests from `/var/www/html/testpage`. The `index` directive specifies `index.html` as the index file.

The `location` block tells Nginx that for URLs beginning with `/` (which should be all URLs), it should first try to serve the requested URI as a file, and then as a directory. If neither of those work, it will respond with a 404 error.

Remember, after modifying your Nginx configuration, you need to check the configuration syntax and then reload or restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Once Nginx configuration is correctly set up and your DNS records for `test.osteotomytool.de` point to your web server's IP address, you can use the `acme.sh` command to generate and install the SSL certificate.

User: 
create a symbolic link in sites-enabled for test.osteotomytool.de  and 
wiki.osteotomytool.de

Assistant: 
To create symbolic links, you should first have configuration files for `test.osteotomytool.de` and `wiki.osteotomytool.de` in the `sites-available` directory.

For every site, create a configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`. For example, create files named `test.osteotomytool.de` and `wiki.osteotomytool.de` or something similar that helps you identify the site.

Once you have created these files, you can create a symbolic link to them in the `sites-enabled` directory. Nginx reads the configuration files from `sites-enabled`.

Here's how you create these symbolic links:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.osteotomytool.de /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wiki.osteotomytool.de /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

After doing this, you should check for syntax errors in your Nginx configurations:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the configuration test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Creating symbolic links in `sites-enabled` from `sites-available` is a common practice to manage server blocks (virtual hosts) in Nginx. You can disable sites without deleting their configuration files by simply removing the symbolic link from `sites-enabled`, and you can re-enable them by recreating the link. Removing the configuration file from `sites-available` will permanently delete your configuration.

User: 
as the pages should also be available with ipv6 address: ` listen [::]:80;` would it be ok to include it like:

```text
server {
    listen 80;
    
    server_name test.osteotomytool.de;

    root /var/www/html/testpage;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Assistant: 
Yes, adding `listen [::]:80;` to your Nginx server block enables the server to listen on IPv6 addresses. Here's how your configuration should look:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name test.osteotomytool.de;

    root /var/www/html/testpage;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

By default, if there's no listen directive in a server block, Nginx will listen on all available interfaces on port 80 for IPv4 and IPv6. But being explicit about makes the configuration clearer and can prevent misunderstandings or misconfigurations.

Remember to check the syntax and reload Nginx after modifying the configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Please, make sure that your DNS AAAA record (used for IPv6) for `test.osteotomytool.de` points to the correct IPv6 address of your server.

`acme.sh --issue -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de -d test.osteotomytool.de -w /var/www/html`
with the project.conf active on the server?

Assistant: 
Yes, you should be able to run the `acme.sh` command to issue the certificates for all the domains/subdomains (including `osteotomytool.de`, `www.osteotomytool.de`, `wiki.osteotomytool.de`, `test.osteotomytool.de`) while your `project.conf` is active on the server. 

However, please note a few things: 

1. Since the ACME protocol performs domain validation, your server (the one pointed to by the DNS records for these domains) needs to serve a certain file under a path specified by the protocol (`/.well-known/acme-challenge/`). This file will then be retrieved over HTTP by the Let's Encrypt servers.

2. For the `acme.sh --issue` command to succeed, you should ensure that for each domain you're requesting a certificate for, there's a server block in your Nginx configuration that uses it in a `server_name` directive and that listens on port 80. This is because the Let's Encrypt servers perform the validation over HTTP (port 80) and not HTTPS (port 443).

Your `project.conf` configuration has already set up server blocks listening on port 80 for `osteotomytool.de`, `www.osteotomytool.de`. 

To ensure successful validation for the `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de` subdomains, you should have already configured server blocks for those subdomains in your Nginx configuration files (as discussed in previous communications).
   
After obtaining the certificates, you will need to update your Nginx configuration to use the newly issued certificates for each of the subdomains and configure them for HTTPS (port 443). 

And then reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

This will download and install `acme.sh` on your system. It also sets up an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file so that you can use `acme.sh` command from any directory, without needing to specify a complete path.

You must either restart your terminal session or source the bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

depending on which file was updated during the installation.

After doing this, you should be able to use `acme.sh` command. Before you issue a certificate, check if `acme.sh` is accessible:

```bash
acme.sh --version
```

Then, assuming your web server is correctly set up and the DNS records are pointing to your server for all the mentioned domains/subdomains, you should be able to execute your certificate issuance command.

[Wed 31 Jan 2024 06:41:26 PM CET] See: https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-debug-acme.sh

Assistant: 
It seems like the ACME client (acme.sh) has encountered an error during verification. The error message suggests adding '--debug' or '--log' for more details. 

Specifically, the `acme.sh` script attempted to verify `osteotomytool.de` but couldn't, most likely because it couldn't retrieve the verification file it placed in the webroot (`/var/www/html`).

Here are a few suggestions for troubleshooting:

1. Make sure that the root directory specified in `-w /var/www/html` is correct and Nginx is configured to serve files from that directory.
2. The domain should point to the IP of the server on which you're running this command.
3. Make sure that port 80 is open on your server and accessible from the internet.
4. The certificate issuer (ZeroSSL) should be able to access `http://osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` and `http://<each of the other domains>/.well-known/acme-challenge/*`

To get more detailed logs about the error, run:

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d osteotomytool.de -d www.osteotomytool.de -d wiki.osteotomytool.de -d test.osteotomytool.de -w /var/www/html --debug
```

This should give you a more clear idea of what the issue might be.

Assistant: 
From the debug log, there's a line:

```text
== Info: subjectAltName does not match test.osteotomytool.de
== Info: SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'test.osteotomytool.de'
```

This suggests that the SSL certificate configured on your server doesn't include `test.osteotomytool.de` as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN), and this is causing verification failure.

The verification process works by:

1. ACME client (acme.sh) requesting the ACME server (ZeroSSL) to verify `test.osteotomytool.de`.
2. The ACME server then sends an HTTP request to `http://test.osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>`.
3. Your server should respond with a correct token generated by ACME client.
   
If step 2 fails due to mismatch in SSL certificates, verification fails too.

There are also lines in the debug log about Nginx and Apache not existing. If web servers aren't properly installed or if they're installed but not in your system's `PATH`, Let's Encrypt validation may also encounter issues.

You should either update your SSL certificate to include `test.osteotomytool.de` or start the issuance process with the `http` option to avoid SSL errors. 

However, because port 80 is usually mandatory for HTTP validation, ensure that:

- Your web server listens on port 80.
- `test.osteotomytool.de` DNS record is set and points to the correct server.
- Firewall settings (or anything else) are not obstructing incoming connections to port 80.

Then, you should be able to issue certificates for your domain.

User: 
in //etc/nginx/conf.d/project.conf:

server {

    listen 80;
    server_name osteotomytool.de www.osteotomytool.de osteotomy.eu www.osteotomy.eu;
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {

    listen [2a01:238:43de:3800:1b46:71d6:c0ea:eb03]:80;
    server_name osteotomytool.de www.osteotomytool.de osteotomy.eu www.osteotomy.eu;
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
the port 80 is rerouted to https://$host$request_uri;. Could this be the reason for the failure?

Assistant: 
Yes, the 301 redirection from HTTP to HTTPS could be the reason for the validation failure. When the ACME server tries to access the URL `http://test.osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>` for validation, it gets redirected to the HTTPS version of the URL. 

If your server's SSL/TLS configuration isn't proper or not yet ready (which seems to be the case as you're trying to issue the SSL certificate), the HTTPS connection will fail, preventing the ACME server from reaching the validation file.

One way to solve this issue is to exclude the `.well-known/acme-challenge` location from the redirection. Try modifying the server block like this:

```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    server_name osteotomytool.de www.osteotomytool.de osteotomy.eu www.osteotomy.eu;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/html; # or the directory acme.sh uses to place files
    }

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# Similar changes for the IPv6 server block
```
Then, restart or reload Nginix:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

This configuration allows the ACME server to access the `http://<your-domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/` URLs without being redirected to HTTPS. So, it should be able to verify your domains successfully.

Assistant: 
It seems the certificate issuance is still failing, with the status being reported as `invalid` for both `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de`. Unfortunately, the detailed error isn't visible in this log.

Given that your Nginx configuration seems to be correctly configured to not redirect requests for `.well-known/acme-challenge`, I'd suggest a couple of further troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the ACME client (`acme.sh`) has sufficient permissions to create and modify files in the `/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory.
   
2. **Manually check challenge file access**: You can manually create a test file in the `/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory and try accessing it from a web browser (e.g., http://<your-domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/test). This should help verify whether the challenge files are being served correctly.
   
3. **Check DNS settings**: Make sure that the DNS records for `test.osteotomytool.de` and `wiki.osteotomytool.de` are correctly pointing to your server.

4. **Check firewall settings**: Ensure your server’s firewall is not blocking access to the `.well-known/acme-challenge/` path.
   
If all these check out and you're still unable to issue the certificate, I would recommend seeking help from acme.sh's support or community as the issue might be more specific to your environment or the tool itself.

Assistant: 
Your directory structure and file ownership/permission look appropriate for serving ACME challenges. The ACME challenge file `KAZpMbH4awlaRpxe4Tcd-OEszBF8iaENGB0Tt3uB0Hg` is present in the directory `/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/`.

However, the ownership of the directories and the file is root. Generally, the ownership of these files should be the same as the user running the web server.

If nginx or Apache are running as `www-data` the directory files should be owned by `www-data`.

To correct file ownership, run:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/.well-known
```

Once this is done, you can do a manual check to ensure the files in `.well-known/acme-challenge` can be accessed from a web browser.

For instance, you can run:

```bash
echo "Test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

Then try to access `http://yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test` in your web browser. It should return "Test file".

If the test file can be accessed successfully, try running the `acme.sh` command again to issue the certificate. If you still encounter issues, please check your server's error logs for more detailed information about why the verification checks might be failing.

Assistant: 
Great! The permissions and ownership appear to be correct now. 

Next, let's attempt to verify the HTTP-01 challenge manually. The ACME client (acme.sh) validates your domain's ownership by placing a validation file in '.well-known/acme-challenge/' directory under your webroot directory and then Let's Encrypt servers try to access this file over the internet.

So, let's create a test file in this directory and then access it over the internet:

Create a test file:

```bash
echo "This is a test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

Make sure the test file is accessible through 

```bash
http://your-domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

Jut replace 'your-domain' with `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de`.

If you can see 'This is a test file' when accessing the URL, that means your server is correctly serving the files under '.well-known/acme-challenge/', and you should be able to issue SSL certificates using acme.sh.

If you cannot access this file, then there might be more configurations to check, such as DNS settings, firewall settings, etc.

User: 
uwe@h2938789://var/www/html$ echo "This is a test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
-bash: /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test: Keine Berechtigung

Assistant: 
Looks like there's a permission issue preventing you from creating the test file. When you see "Keine Berechtigung" (No Permission in English), it means the current user (in this case, `uwe`) does not have write access to the intended directory.

Since the directory `/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/` is owned by `www-data`, you'll need to either change its permissions to allow other users to write, or create the test file as `www-data` or `root`.

### Option 1: Create the test file as `root`:

```bash
sudo echo "This is a test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

### Option 2: Create the test file as `www-data`:

```bash
sudo -u www-data echo "This is a test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

### Option 3: Change the directory permissions

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/
echo "This is a test file" > /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

After creating the test file, ensure it is accessible by attempting to visit `http://your-domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/test` in your web browser.

User: 
could i include uwe to the `www-data` group als well?

Assistant: 
Yes, adding your user `uwe` to the `www-data` group would allow you to create and modify files in directories owned by the `www-data` group, given that the group has write permissions for these directories.

To add `uwe` to the `www-data` group, use the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G www-data uwe
```

The `-a` option tells `usermod` to add the user to the supplementary group(s), and `-G` is followed by the list of groups to which the user is being added.

After executing this command, you will need to logout and then login back for the changes to take effect.

Now `uwe` should have the same permissions to write into `/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/` as `www-data`, assuming the directory has group write permissions. If the directory doesn't have group write permissions, you can add them with:

```bash
sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/
```

This gives write permissions to the group owner of the directory.

Then try to create the test file again.

User: 
uwe@h2938789:~$ curl --request http://your-domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
curl: no URL specified!
curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information

Assistant: 
My apologies for the confusion. In the `curl` command, `your-domain` is a placeholder. You need to replace `your-domain` with your actual domain name. 

So in your case, the commands would be:

```bash
curl http://wiki.osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

and

```bash
curl http://test.osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

These `curl` commands will make a request to each URL. If the setup is correct, each command should return "This is a test file", the contents of the test file we created earlier. 

This confirms that your server is correctly serving files from the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory, and indicates that Let's Encrypt's HTTP-01 challenge should succeed. If you're not seeing the expected output, there may be issues with your DNS or server configuration that we'll need to troubleshoot.

User: 
uwe@h2938789:~$ curl http://test.osteotomytool.de/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
This is a test file

Assistant: 
Great! Your server is correctly serving files from the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory and a connection can successfully be made from a public internet location to this directory on your server.

Let's Encrypt can thus perform domain validation using HTTP-01 challenge by placing a file in this directory and trying to access it over the internet.

Now you can proceed with requesting your SSL certificate using acme.sh or any ACME protocol compatible client. Please remember to replace `your-domain` with your actual domain name.

If you're using acme.sh, the command would be:

```bash
./acme.sh --issue -d your-domain --webroot /var/www/html/
```

Don't forget to replace `your-domain` with your actual domain name, like `wiki.osteotomytool.de` or `test.osteotomytool.de`.

If you encounter issues when issuing the certificate, please provide the error messages for further assistance.

Assistant: 
It appears that the issuance of the SSL certificate failed. The error messages indicate that the HTTP-01 challenge by Let's Encrypt was not successful for both domains: `wiki.osteotomytool.de` and `test.osteotomytool.de`.

The error messages provide some information, but unfortunately, they do not tell us the exact issue that prevented the validation.

Here are some steps to consider for troubleshooting:

1. Check if both domains correctly point to your server's IP address. If your DNS settings were recently updated, you might have to wait for the DNS propagation to complete.

2. Verify if Let's Encrypt can reach your server. Firewalls, network configurations and ISP settings can sometimes prevent Let's Encrypt from reaching your server.

3. Ensure that any Rewrite rules or settings in Nginx do not interfere with serving files from the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory.

4. Ensure that Nginx is correctly configured to serve files from the webroot directory that you've specified (`/var/www/html/`).

5. Look at the Nginx access logs and error logs around the time you tried to issue the certificate. These might contain useful information indicating why Let’s Encrypt couldn’t access the validation file.

Lastly, please double-check the permissions of the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory to ensure that the acme.sh script can write the challenge file, and Nginx can read it. 

And remember to renew your attempt after 24 hours because the error messages indicate a `retry-after` header with `86400` seconds, which is equivalent to one day.

.... cert ....

Assistant: 
Fantastic! It looks like the SSL certificate issuance was successful for `osteotomytool.de` and `www.osteotomytool.de`. Your server was able to pass the HTTP-01 challenge by serving the correct validation files from the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory.

Now, you can move to the next step, which is installing the issued certificate. If you're using nginx, you can install the certificate using the following command:

```bash
acme.sh --install-cert -d osteotomytool.de --key-file /etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.key --fullchain-file /etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.cer --reloadcmd "service nginx force-reload"
```

Remember to replace `/etc/nginx/ssl/` with the actual path where you plan to store your certificates. Also, replace `service nginx force-reload` with the correct command to reload your nginx configuration if it's different.

After running the command, you need to modify your nginx configuration file to use the SSL certificate. Here is a sample configuration block to enable HTTPS:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name osteotomytool.de www.osteotomytool.de;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.cer;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/osteotomytool.de.key;

    ...
}
```

Then, restart or reload your nginx service to apply the changes. 

Now your website should be accessible over HTTPS with the new SSL certificate. Please verify this by navigating to `https://osteotomytool.de` and `https://www.osteotomytool.de` in your web browser.

Always remember to test your renewal process, as Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days. You can force a renewal with the `--force` flag:

```bash
acme.sh --renew -d osteotomytool.de --force
```

Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further help.

Assistant: 
Great! The generated SSL certificate files are stored in the locations you provided:

- Your cert is in: `/home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/osteotomytool.de.cer`
- Your cert key is in: `/home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/osteotomytool.de.key`
- The intermediate CA cert is in: `/home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/ca.cer`
- The full chain certs is there: `/home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/fullchain.cer`

You'll need to point your nginx configuration to these certificate files.

Here is a sample nginx configuration to use the SSL certificate:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name osteotomytool.de www.osteotomytool.de;
    
    ssl_certificate /home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/fullchain.cer;
    ssl_certificate_key /home/uwe/.acme.sh/osteotomytool.de_ecc/osteotomytool.de.key;

    ...
}
```

Make sure you replace the `...` with your actual nginx configuration.

You need to add this configuration to your nginx configuration file (usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).

Remember to reload or restart your nginx service to apply the changes.

Finally, validate that your websites are serving the SSL certificate correctly by visiting `https://osteotomytool.de` and `https://www.osteotomytool.de` in your web browser.

Let me know if you need further assistance.
